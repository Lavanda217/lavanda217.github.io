      <h3>Photoshop</h3>
      <p>I love Photoshop. Honestly! I have been working with him every day for 3 years already. One cannot overestimate the influence of Photoshop on the digital graphics industry - which largely determines how the world around us! I am pretty sure that right now in your room there is at least one thing that Photoshop was involved in in the design. And, of course, the pictures for this article were prepared in Photoshop! The first thing you learn when starting to learn Photoshop is layers. The layer is the backbone of Photoshop.</p>
      <p>Lyrical digression. Do you know that you see your nose all the time, from morning till night? Even right now, reading these lines. It's just that your brain has learned to ignore it. :)<br>
